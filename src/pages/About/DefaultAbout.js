          The Old Ebbitt Grill, Washington's oldest saloon, was founded in 1856
          when, according to legend, innkeeper William E. Ebbitt bought a
          boarding house. Today, no one can pinpoint the houseâ€™s exact location,
          but it was most likely on the edge of present-day Chinatown. <br />
          <br />
          As a boarding house, the Ebbitt guest list read like a Who's Who of
          American History. President McKinley is said to have lived there
          during his tenure in Congress, and Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, Andrew
          Johnson, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt and Warren Harding
          supposedly refreshed themselves at its stand-around bar.
